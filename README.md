# loom eval

This is the evaluation script for LOOM. Each JSON file generated by LOOM contains some statistics. These statistics are used by this Makefile, and the script scripts/tables.py, to render the evaluation tables.

## Requirements

 * gurobi
 * CBC
 * glpk
 * pdflatex
 * LOOM

## How to use

`make tables` generates PDF tables, rendered by pdflatex, for each evaluation. Warning: because of the extremely high solution times of the baseline ILPs and the default timeout of 6 hours this will take several weeks on a standard machine.
